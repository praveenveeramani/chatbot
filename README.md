**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, Groq API, dotenv, Requests, HTML/CSS (UI Styling)
**Live Demo:** [https://simplegroqchatbot.streamlit.app/](https://simplegroqchatbot.streamlit.app/)
*(Note: If the app shows as inactive, click “**Wake up**” to restart it — Streamlit Community Cloud puts inactive apps in sleep mode.)*

**Project Description:**

* Developed an interactive **AI chatbot** using the **Groq API** to simulate natural language conversations.
* Implemented a **Streamlit-based frontend** with a persistent chat interface that maintains session history.
* Integrated a custom backend (`groq_chat.py`) that securely handles API communication using environment variables for API keys.
* Deployed the project on **Streamlit Community Cloud** for free public access and testing.
* Ensured responsive design and intuitive UX with real-time response streaming and visual feedback (loading spinners).

**Key Highlights:**

* Modular architecture separating UI (`app.py`) and backend logic (`groq_chat.py`).
* Secure handling of API credentials using `.env` and `dotenv`.
* Demonstrated skills in **API integration**, **Python web app deployment**, and **LLM-based AI interaction**.
